This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the severity of railway accidents using machine learning techniques. By training and evaluating various models on historical railway accident data, the system classifies accidents as Fatal, Serious, or Non-Serious based on multiple risk factors such as environmental conditions, human factors, and railway parameters.
The final application is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input accident-related data and receive instant severity predictions powered by the best-performing ML model (e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest).
This project demonstrates skills in:

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Supervised learning (classification)

Model evaluation & comparison

UI development using Streamlit

End-to-end deployment and version control via GitHub

It is a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patterns and assisting railway safety agencies in making proactive decisions to prevent severe accidents.
